PHPMonkey's Ragnarok Cpanel  
  
Hey guys,  
This is PHPMonkey's team.  
We're building a most powerful cpanel for Ragnarok Ever.  
We're professional programmers.  
But beside our job, we've decided to make something real good stuff for real good gamers :)  
Thanks for all who use it, and all who supported us.  
  
Guide To Setup This CPanel  
Initially we don't have any own control panel's tables, so you don't need to import any tables in your database  
For connecting control panel with database go to  
application/config/database.php  
and edit the following lines  
	'hostname' => 'localhost',  
	'username' => '',  
	'password' => '',  
	'database' => '',  
  
To Setup your Forum, Downloads, Site links & other configurations, go to  
application/config/phpmonkeys_config.php
